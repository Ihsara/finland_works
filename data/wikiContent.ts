# The DVV (Digital and Population Data Services Agency) 🆔

**Priority: IMMEDIATE**

### The Mission
To legally exist in Finland. Without this, you are a ghost in the system.

### The Prize
Your **Personal Identity Code** (henkilötunnus). It looks like *010190-123X*.
You need this for:
1.  Opening a bank account.
2.  Getting a phone contract.
3.  Getting a tax card.
4.  Visiting a doctor.

### How to get it
*   **Students/Workers:** You might have started the request at Migri.
*   **EU Citizens:** You register your right of residence at Migri, then go to DVV.
*   **Action:** You must visit a DVV service point physically to verify your identity. Book an appointment online WEEKS in advance if possible.

# Migri (Finnish Immigration Service) 🛂

### The Mission
To stay in Finland legally.

### The Prize
Your **Residence Permit Card** (oleskelulupa).

### The Golden Rule: Address Updates
If you move (even to the building next door), you **must** notify DVV/Migri.
*   If Migri sends you a letter asking for information and you don't reply because you didn't get the mail, they can cancel your permit.
*   Always use the Posti "Muuttoilmoitus" (Notification of Move) service immediately.

# Reception Centers (Vastaanottokeskus) 🏢

### Where do I live?
When you seek asylum or temporary protection, you are registered at a reception center.
*   **Housing:** You are offered a bed in a shared room. Families usually get their own room.
*   **Private Accommodation:** You *can* live with friends/relatives, but you must pay the rent yourself. You still need to be registered at a specific reception center to get your money (vastaanottoraha) and health services.

### Right to Work (Asylum)
*   **3-Month Rule:** If you presented a valid passport when applying.
*   **6-Month Rule:** If you did not have a passport.
*   **Temporary Protection (Ukraine):** Immediate right to work.

*   **What it is:** Bank codes (Mobiiliavain / Tunnuslukulaite).
*   **What it unlocks:** Kela, Tax Office (Vero), Health Services (Omakanta), Post Office, Job Applications.

### The Catch-22
Banks are strict. To give you these codes, they often require:
1.  Finnish Personal ID (DVV).
2.  Finnish Address.
3.  Passport + Residence Permit + Finnish ID Card (Policet).

**Advice:** Do not leave the bank until you understand exactly what document is missing. Be persistent.

# The Finnish Job Market 📊

### The "Hidden" Market
*   **Fact:** Approx. 70-80% of jobs in Finland are never advertised publicly. They are filled through internal transfers, networks, or direct headhunting.
*   **Conclusion:** If you only apply to public ads on LinkedIn/Oikotie, you are fighting for the smallest slice of the pie against the highest number of people.

### Growing Sectors
1.  **ICT & Tech:** High demand, English often sufficient.
2.  **Health & Social Care:** Massive shortage (Nurses, Practical Nurses), but requires fluent Finnish/Swedish.
3.  **CleanTech & Energy:** Hydrogen, wind power, battery technology.
4.  **Service & Tourism:** Lapland season (Winter) and Helsinki summer.

# The One-Page CV Standard 📄

Finnish recruiters value efficiency. Do not send a 5-page academic CV unless applying for a PhD.

### Essentials
1.  **Photo:** Yes, it is standard here. Professional, smiling, neutral background.
2.  **Length:** Maximum 2 pages. Ideally 1 page.
3.  **Structure:** 
    *   **Profile/Summary:** 3 sentences at the top. Who you are, what you offer.
    *   **Key Skills:** Bullet points (e.g., "Java", "Project Management", "B2 Sales").
    *   **Experience:** Reverse chronological. Focus on *results*, not just duties.

### The "Gap" Fear
Finns dislike unexplained gaps. If you were unemployed for a year, mention "Sabbatical", "Full-time Studies", or "Parental Leave". Do not leave it blank.

# Cover Letter Strategy ✍️

### Do not repeat your CV
The cover letter answers: "Why do you want *this* job?" and "Why do you fit *this* team?"

### Finnish Style: Direct & Honest
*   **Avoid:** "I am a passionate, enthusiastic ninja superstar." (Too much fluff).
*   **Use:** "I have 5 years of experience in X. I noticed your company uses tool Y. I used tool Y in my previous project to achieve Z."
*   **Length:** Max 1 page. 3-4 paragraphs.
*   **Salary Request:** If the ad asks for a "Palkkatoive", you **MUST** include a number. "According to TES" (Collective Agreement) is a safe answer for blue-collar jobs. For specialists, give a range.

# The Interview: Brutal Honesty 🤝

### The Tone
Finnish interviews are often less formal than US/UK ones, but very structured.
*   **Small Talk:** Very brief. Weather, traffic, then straight to business.
*   **Honesty:** If asked "What is your weakness?", do not say "I work too hard." Say a real weakness and how you manage it. Finns have a built-in radar for BS.

### Silence is Okay
If you answer a question and the recruiter stays silent, **do not panic**. They are processing or writing notes. Do not ramble to fill the silence. Wait.

2.  **Personality Tests:** Hundreds of questions. Be consistent.
3.  **The Interview:** A psychologist will grill you on your life history, motivation, and stress handling.

Finland is a small country. "Everyone knows everyone" is not a joke.
Employers fear **risk**. Hiring a foreigner is seen as a "risk" (language, culture, paperwork).
**Networking reduces risk.** If someone inside the company vouches for you, you skip the line.

### Direct Contact (Open Applications)
*   Don't wait for an ad.
*   Find the **Head of Department** or **Team Lead** on the company site (NOT HR).
*   Email them directly: "I am X. I do Y. I can solve problem Z for you. Can we have coffee?"

It is essential for white-collar jobs.
1.  **Location:** Set it to "Helsinki" (or your Finnish city), not your home country. Recruiters filter by location.
2.  **Keywords:** Use the English AND Finnish job titles in your bio (e.g., "Software Engineer / Ohjelmistokehittäjä").
3.  **Activity:** Commenting on others' posts is more visible than posting your own. Engage with Finnish content (even in English).

# The Hard Truths: Racism & Reluctance 🚧

It is important to be realistic. Finland has a very homogeneous working culture.

### Name Discrimination
*   Studies show that applicants with non-Finnish names need to send 2-4x more applications to get an interview.
*   **Strategy:** Do not take rejections personally. It is a structural issue. Focus on volume and networking.

### The "Finnish Required" Myth
*   Many ads say "Fluent Finnish required" even if the job doesn't need it.
*   **Apply anyway.** If your skills are perfect, they might make an exception.
*   **Pro Tip:** Write the first sentence of your application in Finnish (even if simple) to show effort. "Opiskelen suomea" (I am learning Finnish).

Finland does not have a universal minimum wage law. Wages are defined by **TES (Työehtosopimus)** - The Collective Agreement of your sector.

*   **Probation Period (Koeaika):** Max 6 months. You can be fired (or quit) with no notice.
*   **Working Hours:** Usually 37.5 or 40 hours/week. Overtime MUST be paid (usually +50% or +100%).
*   **Holidays:** You earn ~2-2.5 days of holiday for every month you work.

### The Secret
Basic unemployment money from Kela is low (approx €800/mo taxable).
**Earnings-related allowance** is much higher (based on your salary).

### How to get it
You must join an **Unemployment Fund (Työttömyyskassa)** (e.g., YTK or a specific Union) **while you are working**.
*   **Cost:** Usually €60–€100 per year.
*   **Rule:** You typically need to work and be a member for 26 weeks (approx 6 months) to qualify.
*   **If you get fired:** The fund pays you for up to 300-400 days.

2.  **A2 (Basic Interaction):** Intensive courses. Integration training (Kotoutumiskoulutus) via TE Office.

# The Integration Plan (Kotoutumissuunnitelma) 📝

If you are an unemployed immigrant, TE Office will make a plan with you.
*   **The Deal:** If you follow the plan (e.g., attend Finnish course 20h/week), you get higher integration allowance.
*   **The Trap:** If you miss classes or refuse an internship offered by them, they cut your money.
*   **Review:** The plan is reviewed every 6 months. Be active. Demand the training you need.

# Your Strategy 🎯

1.  **Define the Goal:** "I want to be a Junior Dev in Helsinki."
2.  **Gap Analysis:** "I have the coding skills, but no network and no Finnish."
3.  **Action:** 
    *   Morning: Apply to 1 job (Quality over Quantity).
    *   Afternoon: Learn Finnish (1h).
    *   Weekly: Attend 1 meetup or contact 1 new person.
4.  **Track:** Use Excel or Trello. Job hunting is a project. Manage it like one.
