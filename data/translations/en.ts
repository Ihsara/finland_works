        title: 'Welcome to Finland! 🇫🇮', 
        summary: 'Finland functions on trust, silence, and coffee. This app is your survival guide to understanding the unspoken rules and navigating the bureaucracy of your new home.',
        content: `### Your Survival Guide\n\n**The Philosophy:**\nFinland is a society where systems work, but you must know how to use them. Trust is the currency of interaction, and silence is considered a form of respect, not awkwardness. If you approach Finland with humility, punctuality, and honesty, the country will open up to you.\n\n### How to use this app\n1. **Read:** Browse the guides for bureaucracy and work culture. They are designed to be short, practical, and free of jargon.\n2. **Chat:** Use the AI Assistant. It knows your profile (if you created one) and can give specific advice. For example, "How do I get a tax card as a student?" will get a different answer than "as a specialist".\n3. **Profile:** Keep your info updated. The advice changes drastically depending on whether you are an EU citizen, a student, or a spouse of a Finn.\n\n### The concept of Sisu\nYou will hear this word often. *Sisu* translates roughly to "stoic determination" or "guts". It means continuing even when the odds are against you. Moving to a new country requires Sisu. You will face paperwork, darkness in November, and rejected job applications. But with Sisu, you will make it through.`

        summary: 'The Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV) issues your Personal Identity Code (henkilötunnus). You do not legally exist in the Finnish system without it.',
        content: `**Priority: IMMEDIATE**\n\n### The Mission\nTo legally exist in Finland. Without a registration at the **Digital and Population Data Services Agency (DVV)**, you are a ghost in the system. You cannot open a bank account, get a phone contract, or receive a salary properly.\n\n### The Prize\nYour **Personal Identity Code** (henkilötunnus). Format: *DDMMYY-XXXX*. This number follows you everywhere. Memorize it.\n\n### The Process\n1. **Visit DVV:** You usually need to visit a service point in person (e.g., in Helsinki, Espoo, or Tampere). Book an appointment online *weeks* in advance if possible.\n2. **Documents:** Bring your Passport, Residence Permit card (if applicable), and Employment Contract.\n3. **Municipality of Residence (Kotikunta):** This is crucial. It grants you rights to public healthcare and daycare. To get this, you usually need a permanent address and a contract for at least 1 year (or a permanent job).\n\n### Why you need it\n* **Bank account:** Impossible without it.\n* **Phone contract:** Prepaid only without it.\n* **Tax card:** Cannot work properly without it.\n* **Health services:** Public access depends on your Municipality of Residence.`

        title: 'Migri (Immigration)', 
        summary: 'Migri handles your Residence Permit (oleskelulupa). The queues can be long, so applying online (Enter Finland) and booking appointments early is critical.',
        content: `### The Mission\nTo get your Residence Permit (oleskelulupa). **Migri** is the Finnish Immigration Service.\n\n### Key Steps\n* **Enter Finland:** Always use the online service **Enter Finland**. It is faster and cheaper than paper forms.\n* **Identification:** After submitting online, you must prove your identity. You can do this at a Finnish embassy abroad OR at a Migri service point in Finland. **Book this appointment immediately**, as queues in Helsinki can be weeks long.\n* **Fast Track:** If you are a "Specialist" (earning >3000€/mo with a degree) or a Startup Entrepreneur, you and your family can use the Fast Track service to get a decision in 14 days.\n\n### Extended Permits\nYour first permit (A-permit) is usually for 1 year or the length of your contract. Remember to apply for an extension (jatkolupa) *before* your current one expires. If you let it expire, you may have to stop working immediately.`
